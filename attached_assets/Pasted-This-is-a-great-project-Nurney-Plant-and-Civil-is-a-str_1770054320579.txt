This is a great project. "Nurney Plant and Civil" is a strong name, and moving to a modern, one-page site is the perfect strategy for trade and construction businesses. It reduces friction for the user—they land, see the fleet, see the services, and hit the "Call" button.

Since you are using **Replit** (often referred to as Repl.it), their AI Agent is very capable of reading existing websites and refactoring code.

Here is a comprehensive prompt you can copy and paste directly into the Replit Agent to get the best results.

### The Replit Agent Prompt

**Copy and paste the text inside the block below:**

---

**Role:** You are a Senior Web Developer and SEO Specialist with expertise in creating high-converting sites for the construction and heavy machinery industry.

**Task:** I need you to do a complete design overhaul of my existing website: `https://www.nurneyplantandcivil.ie/`.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **Analyze the Source:** specific attention to the text content and the image assets on the current URL. I want to **keep all existing images** (showing off the fleet and work examples) but present them in a modern masonry grid or carousel.
2. **Tech Stack:** Use HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. This needs to be lightweight, fast, and mobile-responsive.
3. **Structure:** Create a **Single Page Application (One-Page Site)** with smooth scrolling navigation to these sections:
* **Hero Section:** High impact, modern headline, and a clear "Get a Quote" Call to Action (CTA) button.
* **Services:** Bulleted list or cards detailing our capabilities (Civil Engineering, Plant Hire, etc.).
* **Gallery/Fleet:** Display the images from the original site professionally.
* **About:** Brief company history/trust signals.
* **Careers (NEW):** A distinct section near the bottom stating "We Are Hiring." Include text inviting skilled workers to submit a resume and a `mailto:` link for them to send it to.
* **Footer:** Contact details and a social icon linking to our Facebook: `https://www.facebook.com/p/Nurney-Plant-and-Civil-61551672382009/`



**Design & UX Goals:**

* **Aesthetic:** Modern, industrial, and clean. Use a color palette that reflects construction (e.g., high-vis yellows/oranges, slate greys, whites, and blacks).
* **Conversion:** Ensure "Call Now" and "Email Us" buttons are sticky or easily accessible at all times, especially on mobile.
* **SEO:** Implement semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`). Add meta tags optimized for keywords like "Plant Hire Ireland," "Civil Engineering," "Groundworks," and "Nurney Plant and Civil."

**Output:**
Please generate the full code for the `index.html` and any necessary CSS/assets. If you cannot directly scrape the images, please use placeholder images (via Unsplash) in the code but provide comments where I should insert the original image filenames.

### Why this prompt works

* **Role Definition:** By telling Replit it is an "SEO Specialist" and "Senior Developer," it triggers the AI to prioritize code quality and search engine tags over just making it look pretty.
* **The "Keep Images" Constraint:** Replit can sometimes hallucinate new images. This prompt explicitly tells it to prioritize the assets found on your URL.
* **The Tech Stack:** Specifying **Tailwind CSS** is crucial. It ensures the site looks modern immediately without writing thousands of lines of custom CSS. It is the industry standard for "modern" layouts.
* **SEO & Conversion:** We explicitly asked for "Semantic HTML" (which Google loves) and "Sticky buttons" (which gets you more phone calls).

### A note on the Images

Replit's AI Agent can read websites, but sometimes it struggles to download the actual `.jpg` files and save them to your new project folder automatically.

**If Replit gives you the code but the images are missing:**

1. Go to your *old* website.
2. Right-click the best photos of your fleet/work and "Save Image As...".
3. Upload them into the Replit file sidebar (drag and drop).
4. Ask Replit: *"I have uploaded the images named `truck1.jpg`, `digger.jpg`, etc. Please update the gallery code to use these specific files."*

### Next Step

Would you like me to write a short "SEO Description" and a catchy "Hero Headline" for the new site that you can provide to Replit to make the content punchier?
